# Model Adjustments - August 2, 2025

## Critical Performance Issues Identified - August 1st Results

### Performance Summary
- **Accuracy**: 26.7% (4/15 games correct)
- **Expected vs Actual**: Predicted 56.1% accuracy based on July validation
- **Gap**: -29.4 percentage points below expected performance
- **Betting Impact**: Lost £24.82 on Pirates bet, overall negative ROI

### Systematic Failure Analysis

#### 1. MASSIVE OVER-PREDICTION BIAS
**Failed Strong Over Predictions (7/10 strong recommendations):**

| Game | Predicted | Actual | Error | Edge |
|------|-----------|--------|-------|------|
| Orioles @ Cubs | 8.6 | 1 | -7.6 | +1.1 |
| Twins @ Guardians | 8.9 | 5 | -3.9 | +1.9 |
| Astros @ Red Sox | 9.1 | 3 | -6.1 | +1.1 |
| Giants @ Mets | 8.8 | 7 | -1.8 | +1.3 |
| Cardinals @ Padres | 8.8 | 5 | -3.8 | +1.3 |
| Rangers @ Mariners | 9.4 | 7 | -2.4 | +1.9 |

**Average Over-Prediction Error: 4.3 runs per game**

#### 2. Specific Model Weaknesses

**A) Pitcher Dominance Days Missed:**
- Multiple elite pitching performances (1-3 runs) completely missed
- August pitcher quality assessment insufficient
- Elite pitcher detection needs strengthening

**B) August Offensive Decline:**
- Many teams scoring 1-5 runs when we predicted 8-9 runs
- Late summer offensive patterns not properly modeled
- Monthly baseline needs reduction

**C) Weather Model Over-Calibration:**
- Hot August weather predictions failed repeatedly
- Weather coefficients appear over-estimated for late season

**D) False Confidence in Large Edges:**
- Pirates: +2.7 edge (wrong by 24+ runs)
- Rangers: +1.9 edge (wrong by 2.4 runs)  
- Twins: +1.9 edge (wrong by 3.9 runs)
- **Pattern**: Large edges correlated with larger prediction errors

#### 3. What Actually Worked

**Successful Predictions (4/15):**
- Tigers @ Phillies: Over prediction, 1.2 edge ✅
- White Sox @ Angels: Under prediction, 1.1 edge ✅  
- Diamondbacks @ Athletics: Under prediction, 1.1 edge ✅
- Royals @ Blue Jays: Over prediction, 0.9 edge ✅

**Key Insight**: Modest edges (0.9-1.2) performed significantly better than large edges (1.9-2.7)

## Immediate Model Adjustments (August 2, 2025)

### 1. Reduce August Baseline (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Change**: August baseline from 8.1 → 7.6 runs (-0.5 runs)
**Rationale**: Late season offensive decline not captured in current model
**Impact**: All August predictions will start 0.5 runs lower

### 2. Increase Elite Pitcher Impact (HIGH PRIORITY)  
**Change**: Elite pitcher adjustment from -1.1 → -1.5 runs
**Rationale**: Missed multiple dominant pitching performances (1-3 run games)
**Impact**: Better detection of pitcher-dominant games

### 3. Confidence Capping for Large Edges (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Change**: Cap confidence at 70% when edge > 1.5 runs
**Rationale**: Large edges showed highest error rates and false confidence
**Impact**: More realistic confidence for extreme predictions

### 4. Weather Coefficient Reduction (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Change**: Hot weather effects reduced by 25%
- 85-90°F: +0.2 → +0.15 runs
- 90-95°F: +0.3 → +0.23 runs  
- 95°F+: +0.5 → +0.38 runs
**Rationale**: Hot weather predictions failed repeatedly on August 1st
**Impact**: Less aggressive hot weather scoring boosts

### 5. August-Specific Pitcher Fatigue Factor (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Change**: Additional -0.2 run adjustment for August games
**Rationale**: Late season pitcher dominance pattern observed
**Impact**: Accounts for August pitcher effectiveness

## Rollback Plan

### Model Backup
- Current model backed up as: `component-additive-model-backup-aug2.ts`
- Git commit with full history before changes
- Rollback command: `cp component-additive-model-backup-aug2.ts component-additive-model.ts`

### Validation Process
1. Test adjusted model on August 1st games (should improve accuracy)
2. Run against July validation dataset (should maintain 53%+ accuracy)
3. Generate August 2nd predictions for live testing
4. Monitor results for 3-5 days before committing to changes

## Expected Impact

### Immediate Effects
- August predictions will average 0.7-1.0 runs lower
- Confidence ratings will be more conservative for extreme predictions
- Better balance between Over/Under predictions for late season

### Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Baseline and confidence adjustments are conservative
- **Medium Risk**: Weather coefficients might be over-corrected
- **Monitoring Required**: Elite pitcher detection changes need validation

## Success Metrics

### Short-term (3-5 games)
- Accuracy improvement above 40% (vs 26.7% baseline)
- Reduced average prediction error below 3.0 runs
- More balanced Over/Under prediction distribution

### Medium-term (1 week)
- Return to 50%+ accuracy levels
- Maintained edge detection for profitable betting opportunities
- Confidence calibration aligned with actual performance

## Notes
- These adjustments specifically target August 1st failure patterns
- Conservative approach to avoid over-correcting
- Full documentation allows for precise rollback if needed
- Model remains fundamentally sound - adjustments are calibration focused
