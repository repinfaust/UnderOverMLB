## Key Findings

### What Worked Well ✅

1. **Elite Pitcher Recognition:**
   - Max Scherzer vs Matthew Boyd delivered 3-run game
   - Kodai Senga's return limited Braves offense  
   - Tarik Skubal vs Bailey Ober stayed under

2. **Confidence Calibration:**
   - System correctly flagged risky games as NO PLAY
   - Both NO PLAY games had accuracy issues
   - Higher confidence correlates with better outcomes

3. **Data-Driven Approach:**
   - Real starting pitcher data crucial for accuracy
   - No mock data fallbacks prevented false confidence

### Critical Issues ❌

1. **Marlins @ Guardians Explosion:**
   - Predicted: 7.47 runs
   - Actual: 13 runs  
   - **Error:** +5.53 runs (massive miss)
   - **Cause:** Failed to predict offensive explosion

2. **Persistent Under Bias:**
   - 6/7 games predicted Under
   - Market lines were generally accurate
   - System still systematically low

3. **Coors Field Underestimation:**
   - Predicted 9.47, actual 10, market 12.5
   - Still underestimating altitude effects
