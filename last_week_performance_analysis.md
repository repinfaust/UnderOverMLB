## Recommendations

### Immediate Adjustments Needed

1. **Address Under Bias**
   - 94% under predictions is extreme
   - Need to recalibrate baseline scoring expectations

2. **Improve High-Scoring Game Detection**
   - Multiple 13+ run games missed completely
   - Consider offensive explosion factors

3. **Venue-Specific Improvements**
   - Coors Field remains problematic
   - Consider park-specific models

4. **Confidence Recalibration**
   - Current system works well for flagging low-confidence games
   - Maintain 50%+ threshold for playable games

### Betting Strategy Optimization

1. **Focus on SLIGHT recommendations only**
   - 72.7% accuracy on these games
   - Ignore NO PLAY games entirely

2. **Avoid High-Volatility Venues**
   - Coors Field, Globe Life Field, etc.
   - Focus on pitcher-friendly parks

3. **Market Line Integration**
   - August 8 showed good market line integration
   - Use market divergence as additional filter

## Conclusion

The model shows **52.9% overall accuracy** with **72.7% accuracy on playable games**, indicating the confidence system is working well. However, there's a severe under bias (94% under predictions) that needs immediate attention. The system is profitable when following conservative betting strategy but requires calibration adjustments for better overall performance.

**Status:** Marginally profitable but needs bias correction before increased deployment.
